# TriviaGame

## Description
This trivia game was developed using JavaScript and jQuery. One question is shown at a time while a timer ticks down. When we click an answer, it will tell us whether or not we are correct or incorrect, and it will move on to the next question. The final screen will show the total number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. The game's theme is all about twins!
